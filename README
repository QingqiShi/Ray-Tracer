For this part of the coursework, only a single executable will be produced to showcase all extensions at once.

To compile, run the following command:
    $ make

This will produce an executable "raytracer" inside the Build folder. Go into this folder to execute it.
    $ cd Build
    $ ./raytracer

This program will take a coupe seconds to render the first preview. The longer you wait, the more refined the preview will become.

This program was treated as a render, not an interactive program. For real-time interactive program, see the rasteriser part of the CW.
